## First Thing : Generate an Access Token for this Repository to last all semester

Ensure you have access all semester, go to Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens to "Generate A New Token" associated with your local machine all semester. You can customize the length of time (to end of 2022) and select access to read/write to this repository. The token generated is a long string of characters that you then use _as your password_ when cloning this repository to a local machine for the first time using TortoiseGit.

After that, the local machine will simply have access without this special token. (if you ever need to, you can just generate a new one the same way and again use it in place of your password to access this repository)

## Everyday Use of this Repository

This repository includes an Issues list, with Milestones, and integrated Projects to track development in a trello-board (Kanban) way.

Wondering what to do? Check out the Issues list for the latest activity and/or browse the earliest Project for items in the "To Do" column you can take on.

0. Please first "Clone" a local copy of this repository; _only need to do that once per local machine_.

1. Then, when starting a short burst of work, please first "Sync" (a.k.a. Pull) the latest version of the repository.
2. Next, work until a small definable increment of progress is made; making sure everything runs please!
3. Before you push your work onto the repository, Pull once more. This will ensure your push is going to be easier.
4. At that time, please do "Commit and Push" (all at once), to try and integrate a save of this progress to the repository; remember to include a concise and meaningful description of your commit, starting with your name. NOTE: descriptions that use "#" can refer and link to an issue item number directly (ex. "pacman - #1. created template folder system, framework includes events, menu and audio mgmt.")

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you're done for the time you're working (in-class, between breaks, etc).

Start again with step 1 if you've come back to work after a length of time, to ensure you're not missing other people's work.

You Got This!
